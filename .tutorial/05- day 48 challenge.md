# ðŸ‘‰ Day 48 Challenge

Today's challenge is to create a high score table.

Your program should:

1. Ask the user to input their three letter initials and score (out of about 100,000).
2. Save both those values into a file called 'high.score'.
3. This should use append mode. If the file doesn't exist, it should be created. If it does, the score should be added to the end.
4. Each new entry score should go on a new line as *initials space score*. Then start a new line for the next entry.
5. Add 2-3 scores for testing in a loop.
6. The loop should ask the user if they've finished entering data and stop if they have.

ðŸ¥³ Extra points for getting all the inputs with just one `input` command and the `split` function.

Example:

```
ðŸŒŸHIGH SCORE TABLEðŸŒŸ

Input your initials > DJM
Input your score > 89,764

Added to high score table.
Add another? y/n? y

Input your initials > ACY
Input your score > 5,731

Added to high score table.
Add another? y/n? n
```
